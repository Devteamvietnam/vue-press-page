# Common problem
### Why not Ant Design Vue?
[Ant Design Pro Vue](https://github.com/vueComponent/ant-design-vue-pro) Yes [Ant Design Pro](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro) The Vue version of the project structure, components,
The layout and usage are basically consistent with the react version of Ant Design Pro. If you are more familiar with the react version, or you are already using it, this is indeed a good choice.

[VueAdmin](https://github.com/Devteamvietnam/vue-admin.git) also implements all the functions of Ant Design Pro. At the same time, we have made corresponding modifications and optimizations to some components and layouts of Ant Design according to the characteristics of Vue, without affecting the consistency with Ant Design.

In addition, we are still adding some features that Ant Design Pro doesn't have, such as global animation and multi-tab mode.

If you want to use Ant Design Pro, but feel that it lacks some of the features you want, you might as well take a look at [Vue Admin](https://github.com/Devteamvietnam/vue-admin.git), we will seriously consider The needs of each user.

Therefore, if you have some good ideas and suggestions, please feel free to communicate with us. It is likely that your ideas will be implemented in our next version.
